  # In some cases (e.g. Post), an Atom::Entry will usually be returned describing the newly created entry. Operations such as Delete do not return an Atom::Entry.
  # If the Sword server does not automatically return the Atom::Entry but instead provides a link to it, the DepositReceipt object will automatically fetch it.
